                  <p>When undergoing a summer internship at Aqua Green (a local hydroponic salad company), one of our team members observed the warehouse staff carrying bags of tuna fillets from the cold rooms and dumping them into large green trash tanks - despite the fact that little to no spoilage odor was developed. The company made this seemingly unreasonable decision to ensure the quality of its final product as hot summers in Hong Kong create inevitable gaps in cold chain management.</p>
                  <p>As confirmed by Willem Landman,  the company’s Technical Director, it is difficult for the Quality Control staff to conveniently and accurately determine if the fish is spoiled or safe to consume, especially since most of the inspection is performed manually, which introduces subjectivity and quality variability. This problem is worsened by the fact that some fish fillets were found to be spoiled even before the expiry date due to the aforementioned inconsistent cold chain issue.</p>
                  <p>Various discussions with Mr. Landman, who also has years of experience in corporate food quality control, suggest that a <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">convenient and affordable testing kit</span> to detect fish spoilage levels would help the business greatly by reducing health risks and the economic costs of discarding fish that might not have been spoiled.</p>
                  <p>Inspired by this incident, we decided to investigate this issue locally and globally by performing further research and interacting with the various stakeholders.</p>

                  <h5><strong>Local Fish Consumption</strong></h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>As the second largest seafood consumer per capita in Asia and the eighth globally, Hong Kong imported more than 33,000 tons of fish and produced 112,000 tons of fisheries locally in 2021<sup><a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/fish_cap/fish_cap_latest/fish_cap_latest.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>. The Fish and Seafood segment is expected to continue growing by 3.05% in the next five years, generating up to <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">5.05 billion USD in revenue</span> in the year 2022<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/food/fish-seafood/hong-kong" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>. Fish is no doubt an essential part of our everyday cuisine, from local wet markets to chain supermarkets to high-end hotel restaurants. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/put-under-local-fish-consumption-in-background.png" width=80%/></p>
                  <p>In our consumer surveys (with 40% of responses from Hong Kong consumers and the rest distributed among the U.S., Japan, Korea, and mainland China), we learned that more than 85% of respondents consume fish at least once per week, with almost 20% of them consuming more than 4 times per week, and that 30% of them mainly purchase fish from wet markets and almost 60% from the supermarket. These results indicate high consumption volume and <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">the need for stricter fish quality control at these handling points.</span> </p>
                  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/put-under-local-fish-consumption-in-background-as-well.png" width=80% /></p>
                  <hr>
                  
                  <h5><strong>Global Fish Consumption</strong></h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>Looking into the global market, we observe a dramatic increase in global fish consumption from 9.0 kg per capita in 1961 to 20.3 kg in 2017 as international food trading became increasingly convenient<sup><a href="https://europeche.chil.me/post/almost-8025-of-the-fish-consumed-worldwide-comes-from-sustainable-stocks-evidenc-303635#:~:text=Global%20fish%20consumption%20rose%20from,capita%20intake%20of%20animal%20protein." target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>. Despite a small decrease in the past few years, it is reasonable to assume that fish consumption level will rise back up as more countries are relaxing their Covid restrictions for imports and exports in the year 2022.</p>
                  <hr>

                  <h5><strong>Bioamines Level as an Indicator of Fish Quality</strong></h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>Produced by bacterial decarboxylation of specific amino acids as the seafood’s shelf life reaches its end, bioamines can be considered a <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">spoilage level index.</span> This correlation was long established by scientists more than forty years ago in the form of a biogenic amine index, as shown below.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/project-description-photo1.png" /></p>
                  <p>In recent years, the scientific community continues to apply this correlation to develop devices that detect spoilage levels in different food products, including a team from Flinders University that measures bioamines levels for monitoring salmon spoilage.</p>
                  <p>Although food safety regulatory bodies in different regions have different upper limits for bioamine concentration, it is observed by many studies that consuming food with a high level of bioamines leads to intoxication like <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">Scombrotoxin Fish Poisoning and Tyramine Toxicity</span><sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921096/#CR26" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>, potentially resulting in the following symptoms:</p>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Burning sensation around mouth or throat</li>
                      <li>Rashes on the upper body</li>
                      <li>Dizziness</li>
                      <li>Nausea</li>
                      <li>Vomiting</li>
                      <li>Heart palpitation</li>
                      <li>Respiratory difficulty</li>

                  <p>With such a <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">high fish consumption and bioamines risks</span> involved, its <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">quality assurance</span> has become an increasingly significant issue.</p>

                  <p>The negative impacts brought by the current fish spoilage problems are three-fold: food waste, quality variability, and bioamine poisoning.</p>

                    <h5><strong>Food Waste</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Fish spoilage leads to substantial food waste annually. Although local statistics are not easily accessible, it is estimated that around 20% of the total fish weight harvested globally per year was lost due to microbial contamination and spoilage. Assuming Hong Kong has a below-average loss rate of 10%, this signifies an annual loss of <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">14,500 tons</span> of fish, which is enough fish for more than <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">one million people</span> per year according to the recommended fish intake by the Washington State Department of Health.</p>
                    <p>Even though most fish businesses in Hong Kong are reluctant to disclose the amount of fish discarded due to potential spoilage, our on-site research in Thailand suggests that up to 30% of fish parts were thrown away if unsold by the end of the day - even if the fish looks and smells normal. Businesses do this to decrease the chance of selling potentially spoiled fish to their customers. This finding confirms the substantial amount of food waste resulting from not knowing if the fish is spoiled for sure or not.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h5><strong>Quality Variability</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Secondly, many local fish businesses indicate that fish spoilage detection is performed manually by experienced fishermen, which introduces quality variability. According to Mr. Willem Landman, this variability amplifies throughout the supply chain and results in significant economic loss when the fish products reach the final retailers or end consumers. Mr. Henry Yip from the Hong Kong Fish Marketing Organization (FMO) also confirms the presence of this issue and emphasizes that different quality inspection standards at different handling points in the supply chain further aggravate the problem.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/project-description-3.png"/></p>
                    <hr>

                    <h5><strong>Bioamines Poisoning</strong></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, although often confused with allergy, poisoning cases due to fish spoilage cannot be neglected. Just a few months ago, on June 8th, the Hong Kong Center for Food Safety reported a histamine poisoning outbreak in a local restaurant involving tuna fillets; this adds to the 26 group histamine poisoning outbreaks in Hong Kong in recent years. </p>
                    <p>Similar cases are also observed worldwide in regions like Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Sweden, Italy, Spain, and many more. According to Food Safety authorities in multiple countries, <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">even a fish with a seemingly good appearance and no detectable odors of spoilage can contain a high level of bioamines,</span> posing serious health threats without the presence of a convenient bioamine detector.</p>
                    <p>Despite the difficulty in estimating the number of consumers affected, it is nevertheless an important health issue to address both locally and internationally.</p>

                  <p>Upon confirming the problems, we began investigating existing or proposed solutions to see how we can develop a more comprehensive and effective product.</p>
                  <p>As described by the local seafood businesses that we interviewed, rigorous quality inspection procedures are usually performed at third-party testing laboratories, which could take up to three to five days. Although major quality inspection service providers like HQTS Group and Pro QC provide comprehensive testing reports, the interviewees explained that using external services could lead to <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">much higher time, monetary, and logistical costs</span> compared to an in-house testing procedure.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:center"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/place-under-the-second-paragraph-of-current-methods.png" width=80%/></p>
                  <p>Food experts around the world have observed similar problems in their own communities and begun developing more convenient quality inspection methods. Take Quality Certified Foods as an example, they are “a group of scientists and food professionals that measure and quantify the quality of foods through bio-metric technology”. While their Certified Quality Reader 3.0 allows businesses to perform in-house quality inspection, it is still relatively expensive and has not been widely accepted by the general market; we suspect that their lack of public presence is due to their marketing strategy to target <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">high-end food providers</span> instead of the general food businesses - which are who our project targets.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:center"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4225/wiki/place-under-the-third-paragraph-of-current-methods.png" width=80%/></p>
                  <p>Apart from fully commercialized products and services, we also looked into other research teams who are developing similar products in innovative ways. A team from the City University of Hong Kong has been working on a sensor that detects histamine and formaldehyde (the latter being an illegal additive used in seafood as preservatives but is hazardous to human health); their detection method is based on “the selective bonding interaction in vapor and liquid phase”. Having received a grant worth 20 million RMB from the Ministry of Finance, State Oceanic Administration, and Xminnov, the team aims to provide a rapid screening test that complies with the <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">standards established by WHO and FDA.</span></p>
                  <p>Apart from AOAC 977.13, a widely accepted but complicated method for histamine testing, there is currently a gap in the market for a quick and user-friendly bioamines testing kit. </p>
                  <p>All these projects further convinced us of the urgency to provide a convenient method to detect food spoilage and showed us the different aspects that we can improve on top of these existing solutions.</p>

                  <p>Upon studying the entire operational flow of a fish processing business in Hong Kong, we learned that even with proper certification and equipment for cold chain management, <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">temperature inconsistency</span> can still occur due to physical restriction, external environment, or human erroneous factors, leading to the need to measure fish spoilage levels at specific control points.</p>
                  <p>As such, we envision our testing kit to be incorporated into an existing framework in order to maximize the benefits it brings to the aforementioned stakeholders.</p>
                  <p>Initially developed by NASA to ensure food safety during space operations, the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system is “an effective and rational means of assuring food safety from harvest to consumption” (FDA). It is now widely implemented in the food industry and recognized as a global food quality standard. As HACCP has become compulsory for the U.S. “manufacturers of meat and poultry, seafood, and juice products” and specific food production businesses in some other developed countries, the Hong Kong regulatory body expressed their desire to follow the footsteps of international standards and <span style="color:#678BD6;font-weight:bold">further incorporate HACCP into the local food industry.</span><sup><a href="https://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/multimedia/multimedia_pub/multimedia_pub_fsf_117_02.html#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20decades%2C%20HACCP,and%20poultry%20establishments%20in%20Canada." target="_blank">[5]</a></sup></p>
                  <p>According to a research report performed by Data Bridge<sup><a href="https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-food-certification-market" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>, the global food certification market is expected to grow, indicating that more businesses in the food industry will incorporate Quality Assurance and Quality Control systems into their operations, including HACCP, which is one of the most popular and recognized frameworks. They explain that this growth is driven by the “rising consumer awareness regarding food safety, stringent food certification and standards and rising number of government initiatives to ensure food safety”.</p>
                  <p>Combining all the interviews, surveys, and studies, we believe that incorporating our testing kit in the HACCP framework would fill to current fish inspection gap and provide a more affordable alternative for smaller businesses to fulfill regulatory requirements.</p>
